=== Assumptions ===

1. git repo is locally cloned
2. R studio is available in the system
3. working directory in r-studio is set to the root of the project. e.g. if the root of the repo on local filesystem is '~/coursera/getdata-005/project' then setwd('~/coursera/getdata-005/project') should be executed in r-studio before sourcin run_Analysis.R

=== Output ===
On running 'run_Analysis.R' script final_tidy_data.txt is generated. This file contains the cleaned up data.
